### Enzyme Stability Prediction

- Food packaging shows us the amount of protein in each product, but it might seem like protein is just one thing. In reality, there are many types of proteins, and each is made up of 20 amino acids. Some proteins, like enzymes, have specific roles in biology, and they are the focus of this study.

- This notebook will mainly explore insights from a large set of enzyme data. Creating a model to understand their characteristics and predict unknown cases could be valuable beyond just the test data, which has unique features.

- The problem revolves around the fact that enzymes have specific 3-D structures that allow them to function. The challenge is to predict when these structures break down or become denatured at certain temperatures.
